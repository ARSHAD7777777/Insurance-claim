# Insurance claim prediction
# Introduction:
## This is an Insurance Claim Prediction Data Set. The bigger scope is to account for inaccuracies in the cost of insurance policies. A cautious driver should get a better price compared to a reckless driver. The aim is to build a machine learning model to predict whether an auto insurance policy holder files a claim.

# Dataset description:
## In data, features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature names (e.g., ind, reg, car, calc). In addition, feature names include the postfix bin to indicate binary features and cat to indicate categorical features. Features without these designations are either continuous or ordinal. Values of -1 indicate that the feature was missing from the observation. The target columns signifies whether or not a claim was filed for that policy holder.
